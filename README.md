There will be a checkbox to show if you are a developer or not, by default it is selected for you assuming you are in fact a developer. Once you have an account you are free to edit your profile. On your profile you will be able to add your skills, a brief biography, and list some of your projects. Additionally you will be able to add a profile picture.

On the homepage you will be able to search through the accounts of other developers by the skills they have listed on their profiles. Once on their page you will able to view the full list of the their skills and projects, as well as their biographies. You will also be able to send messages to them to communicate about projects either you or they may be interested in.

If you opt to not have a developer account you will instead be able to add a list of developers to your account that you may be interested in hiring for a project or for job opportunities. You will still maintain the same ability to message developers to communicate such opportunities.
